Hello and welcome to my dev blog. I'm Tyhjakuori a self-taught programmer. I have liked programming for a long time now, 
but i started this journey semi-seriously about 3 years ago. Languages so far that i have been dabbling into are: batch, python,
java, perl, bash, html, c and javascript. A lot of different languages i know, but it feels like i haven't found 
the language for me yet. 

My journey started about 7 years ago, soon to be 8 as it's december now. The first language i programmed something was batch. 
Back then i stumpled across few forum sites which had all kinds of scripts and programs including malware available. 
That caught my intrest(not the malware) and i started copying batch files to my pc. Trying to figure out what did what 
was so exciting, like trying to figure out puzzle. One other factor was my friend back then, that had been trying to learning VBS and batch. 
Then sending me the programs trying to disguise them as fake viruses.

Of course the first batch program i did was the "Hello World"

{% highlight batch %}
{% raw %}
@echo off
title .
echo Hello World
pause
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This was the first program i was so proud of after getting it to work, as it reminded me of ps1 loading screens.

{% highlight batch %}
{% raw %}
@echo off
title Loading
color 0b
:A
cls
echo Loading.
ping localhost -n 2 >nul
cls
echo Loading..
ping localhost -n 2 >nul
cls
echo Loading...
ping localhost -n 2 >nul
cls
echo Loading.
ping localhost -n 2 >nul
cls
echo Loading..
ping localhost -n 2 >nul
cls
echo Loading...
ping localhost -n 2 >nul
cls
goto :A
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

So that was the "flame" that lighted the torch inside me. However the flame didn't burn too long back then as i forgot about programming
till year 2019. That year i started to get back into programming as humblebundle had programming e-book bundles on sale. The idea of 
starting programming again had showed it's head.   

After that i have read multiple programming books for multiple languages including: python ebooks, java ebook, C books.

And so we come to this day, after a lot of frustration, failure, learning and success. This might not be an inspiring nor great story, but it is my story.

I look forward to many things related to programming this next year. Including writing this blog/site, releasing gemini site and many projects that i have 
planned or what comes to mind during the year.

I wish everyone a happy year 2022!
